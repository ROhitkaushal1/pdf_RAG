Fiserv, its Affiliates and their respective successors, and each of their respective directors, officers, and employees shall be named as additional insureds on this policy either by a blanket endorsement, in which case, a copy is not required; or by a separate endorsement if required by the insurance carrier, such separate endorsement to be provided to Fiserv. d. Umbrella Liability Insurance which shall provide excess, follow-form coverage with respect to the liability coverage required in subsections (a), (b), and (c) herein in an amount of $5,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate. e.

All of the foregoing policies shall be issued by insurance companies maintaining an A.M. Best Company rating of \u201cA-VII\u201d or better. These insurance provisions set forth the minimum amounts and scopes of coverage to be maintained by Vendor and its Subcontractors and are not to be construed in any way as a limitation of its liability under this Agreement. If Vendor\u2019s Subcontractors do not maintain the insurance required herein, Vendor shall endorse its policies to cover its Subcontractor\u2019s activities under this Agreement. 3. All deductibles specified in the required insurance policies shall be assumed by and are for the account of Vendor or its Subcontractor(s). Where allowed by law or regulation, all insurance coverage shall be primary and will not participate with nor will be excess over any valid and collectable insurance or program of self-insurance carried by Fiserv.

Should Vendor receive notice of cancellation or a material reduction in any of the required policies, Vendor shall promptly provide Fiserv with no less than 30 days prior written notice of the same, unless such coverage is immediately replaced with similar coverage in scope and limits. Vendor will also provide certificates of insurance for any approved Subcontractors to Fiserv upon Fiserv\u2019s request. Failure of Vendor or any Subcontractor to provide any certificate(s) of insurance shall not absolve Vendor or any Subcontractor of its responsibility to maintain the required insurance. 39  DocuSign Envelope ID: DOC25AC0-315D-43D6-A423-CB9C9D93FD75 CW2484387", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4527, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f323372-4a69-496f-b508-e34186f58794": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f323372-4a69-496f-b508-e34186f58794", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_number": 36}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2157497e-7071-4625-979a-92366d896690", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_number": 36}, "hash": "bb3ac854e3608340c568d21a4d16f37dc38503ce8fde83f211c0f43e11645550", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Following content is of title: Annex C is PART A Choice of SCC Module (ii) the SCCs (iv) Annex 1: A: List of Parties \u2610 Module 2 (controller to processor) OR \u2610 Module 3 (processor to (sub) processor) OR \u2610 Both Modules 2 and 3 (controller to processor and processor to (sub) processor) Clause 9: Option 1 (specific prior authorisation for sub-processors) and the parties agree: 1) that the time period for submitting requests for authorisation shall be sixty days; 2) that the Vendor shall submit any request for authorisation to Fiserv which shall liaise with the controller in relation to such authorisation; Clause 17 (Governing law): the clauses shall be governed by the laws of Ireland; and Clause 18 (Choice of forum and jurisdiction): the courts of Ireland shall have jurisdiction. 1) The data exporter shall be Fiserv at the address set out in details of the parties above; the contact person for Fiserv shall be: dpo@fiserv.com; [Insert details of the activities relevant to the data transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses]; the signature of the data exporter and the date of signature (i) (iii) Options selected under (v) (vi) shall be as below; and the role of the exporter is [processor] [and] [controller]; 2) The data importer shall be the Vendor at the address set out in details of the parties above; the contact person for the vendor shall be: [Provide relevant details]; [Insert details of the activities relevant to the data transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses]; the signature of the data importer and the date of signature shall be as below; and 40  DocuSign Envelope ID: DOC25AC0-315D-43D6-A423-CB9C9D93FD75 CW2484387 B: Description of transfer the role of the importer is [processor] [and] [(sub) processor].

The Parties shall ensure that the Vendor shall not have access to the personal data in clear-text.

To ensure this: 2. (a) Before transferring the personal data, Fiserv shall process it in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject, nor be used to single out the data subject in a larger group without the use of additional information; (b) that additional information shall be held exclusively by Fiserv and kept separately in a Member State or in a third country, by an entity trusted by Fiserv in the EEA or under a jurisdiction offering an essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed within the EEA; (c) Fiserv shall ensure that disclosure or unauthorised use of that additional information is prevented by appropriate technical and organisational safeguards; (d) Fiserv shall ensure that it retains sole control of the algorithm or repository that enables re-identification using the additional information; and (e) Fiserv has established by means of a thorough analysis of the data in question - taking into account any information that the public authorities of the recipient country may be expected to possess and use - that the pseudonymised personal data cannot be attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person even if cross-referenced with such information.

The Vendor warrants and represents that: (a) it has not purposefully created back doors or similar programming that could be used to access the personal data processed in connection with this Addendum; (b) it has not purposefully created or changed its business processes in a manner that facilitates access to such personal data; and (c) law or government policy to which Vendor is subject does not require the Vendor to create or maintain back doors or to facilitate access to such personal data; and (d) if the personal data processed by Vendor is encrypted, Vendor is not obliged to be in possession or to hand over the encryption key; (e) it will notify Fiserv if, at any time it is unable to continue complying with this commitment and agrees that Fiserv may terminate the Agreement on such notice period as is stipulated by Fiserv if Vendor breaches this provision.

The Vendor agrees to: (a) provide the notification under clause 15.1 of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses before access is granted to personal data; (b) monitor any legal or policy developments that might lead to its inability to comply with its obligations under this Addendum and promptly inform Fiserv of any such changes and developments, if possible ahead of their implementation.
